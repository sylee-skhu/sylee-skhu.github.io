Warm greetings!

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Division of Future Convergence at Sungkonghoe University, Seoul, Republic of Korea. I currently have a focus on Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Robotics, encompassing everything from theoretical foundations to diverse industrial applications. My passion lies in exploring how these cutting-edge technologies can be integrated to innovate and advance our understanding and capabilities in the field.

Before accepting this position, I worked in the Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. as a Senior Researcher. I studied for my Ph.D. at Durham under the supervision of [Euntai Kim](https://cilab.yonsei.ac.kr/) and completed this in 2018 with a dissertation entitled 'Deep Neural Network based Discriminative Feature Learning and Its Application to Multiple Object Tracking'.

Apart from my academic pursuits, I enjoy running, playing League of Legends, and exploring the world of wines.
